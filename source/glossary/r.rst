RPM Package Manager (RPM) (originally Red Hat Package Manager; now a recursive 
acronym) is a package management system.[5] The name RPM refers to the 
following: the .rpm file format, files in the .rpm file format, software 
packaged in such files, and the package manager program itself. RPM was 
intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline 
package format of the Linux Standard Base.

Even though it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many 
Linux distributions. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, 
such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3) and IBM's AIX (as of version 4).
An RPM package can contain an arbitrary set of files. The larger part of RPM 
files encountered are “binary RPMs” (or BRPMs) containing the compiled version 
of some software. There are also “source RPMs” (or SRPMs) files containing the 
source code used to produce a package. These have an appropriate tag in the 
file header that distinguishes them from normal (B)RPMs, causing them to be 
extracted to /usr/src on installation. SRPMs customarily carry the file 
extension “.src.rpm” (.spm on file systems limited to 3 extension characters, 
e.g. old DOS FAT).
