========

Homebrew is a free and open-source software package management system that
simplifies the installation of software on Apple's OS X operating system.
Originally written by Max Howell, the package manager has gained popularity in
the Ruby on Rails community and earned praise for its extensibility. Homebrew
has been recommended for its ease of use as well as its integration into the
command line.

Homebrew has made extensive use of GitHub in order to expand the support of
several packages through user contributions. In 2010, Homebrew was the
third-most-forked repository on GitHub. In 2012, Homebrew had the largest
number of new contributors on GitHub. In 2013, Homebrew had both the largest
number of contributors and issues closed of any project on GitHub.

Homebrew has spawned several sub-projects such as Linuxbrew which is a Linux
port and Homebrew-Cask which is an external command allowing installation of
GUI applications,[8] as well as "taps" dedicated to specific areas or
programming languages like Homebrew PHP.
