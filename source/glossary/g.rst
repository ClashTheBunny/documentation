  The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the GNU
  Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of
  the GNU toolchain. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) distributes GCC under
  the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL). GCC has played an important role
  in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.

  Originally named the GNU C Compiler, when it only handled the C programming
  language, GCC 1.0 was released in 1987. It was extended to compile C++ in
  December of that year (the default support in the current version is
  gnu++14, a superset of C++14 (or gnu11 a superset of C11) with strict
  standard support also available, and experimental C++17 and later). Front
  ends were later developed for Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Java,
  Ada, and Go among others.

  "Version 4.5 of the OpenMP specification is now supported in the C and C++
  compilers" and "a much improved implementation of the OpenACC 2.0a
  specification" is also supported.

  GCC has been ported to a wide variety of processor architectures, and is
  widely deployed as a tool in the development of both free and proprietary
  software. GCC is also available for most embedded systems,[citation needed]
  including ARM-based; AMCC, and Freescale Power Architecture-based chips. The
  compiler can target a wide variety of platforms.

  As well as being the official compiler of the GNU operating system, GCC has
  been adopted as the standard compiler by many other modern Unix-like
  computer operating systems, including Linux and the BSD family, although
  FreeBSD and OS X have moved to the LLVM system. Versions are also
  available for Microsoft Windows and other operating systems; GCC can compile
  code for Android and iOS.

git
===

  Git is a version control system that is used for software development and
  other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it
  is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear
  workflows. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning
  fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
  and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging
  areas, and multiple workflows.

github
======

  GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the
  distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality
  of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and
  several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests,
  task management, and wikis for every project.

  GitHub offers both plans for private repositories, and free accounts which
  are commonly used to host open-source software projects. As of April 2016,
  GitHub reports having more than 14 million users and more than 35 million
  repositories, making it the largest host of source code in the world.

  The trademark mascot of GitHub is Octocat, an anthropomorphized cat with
  cephalopod limbs, portrayed in a manga style.

  LizardFS uses Github for its source code repository and bug reporting
  location.
