OSXFuse
=======

  FUSE for macOS allows you to extend macOS's native file handling
  capabilities via third-party file systems. It is a successor to MacFUSE,
  which has been used as a software building block by dozens of products,
  but is no longer being maintained.

    ** Features **

  As a user, installing the FUSE for macOS software package will let you use
  any third-party FUSE file system. Legacy MacFUSE file systems are supported
  through the optional MacFUSE compatibility layer.

  As a developer, you can use the FUSE SDK to write numerous types of new file
  systems as regular user space programs. The content of these file systems
  can come from anywhere: from the local disk, from across the network, from
  memory, or any other combination of sources. Writing a file system using
  FUSE is orders of magnitude easier and quicker than the traditional approach
  of writing in-kernel file systems. Since FUSE file systems are regular
  applications (as opposed to kernel extensions), you have just as much
  flexibility and choice in programming tools, debuggers, and libraries as you
  have if you were developing standard macOS applications.
