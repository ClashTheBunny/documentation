SAN/Storage Area Network
========================

.. container:: auth-status-writing

  A storage area network (SAN) is a network which provides access to 
  consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to enhance
  storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical 
  jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear to the 
  operating system as locally attached devices. A SAN typically has its own 
  network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the 
  local area network (LAN) by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs
  dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both 
  enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.
  
  A SAN does not provide file abstraction, only block-level operations. 
  However, file systems built on top of SANs do provide file-level access, 
  and are known as shared-disk file systems.
