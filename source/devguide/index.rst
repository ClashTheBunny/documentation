Developers and users can contribute to the LizardFS development in many ways and everyone is welcome in the project.

Users can, for instance, help the development by testing beta releases of the
software, reporting and testing of bugs, writing documentation, translate man
pages and documentation to your native language, spreading the word and
promote LizardFS. In this guide we will be concentrating in helping people
