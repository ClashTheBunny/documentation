**Why is it called LizardFS ?**
  It's a metaphor for something that can grow back if partially lost

**Can I move my systems from MooseFS to LizardFS ?**
  Yes. This is documented in the :ref:`upgrading` manual.

**Why a fork from MooseFS ?**
  *  At the time we did the fork there was nearly no movement in the GIT repo
     of MosseFS
  *  Only 2 devs had access to the sourceforge repo and there were no more
     committers
  *  increase in the number of possible contributors with a simultaneous lack
     of response on the part of MooseFS maintenance
