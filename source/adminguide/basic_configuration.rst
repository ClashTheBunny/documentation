Basic Configuration
*******************

There are a range of settings that must be done on every server before we start working with LizardFS itself.

* setup all participating hosts in the /etc/hosts file

* setup time synchronization via ntp

* select the filesystem type and create the filesystems the chunkservers shall 
  use 

* adjust network settings

* adjust kernel settings
